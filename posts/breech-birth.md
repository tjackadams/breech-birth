Hello. My name is Faye and I wanted to write my experience on a vaginal breech delivery I had with my second son (and my last child!) on 11th June 2021. 
When I was offered a vaginal breech delivery, I couldn’t find any blog on peoples personal experiences and only articles which I didn’t find helpful. I wanted to ask questions of someone who had actually experienced it. Hence I have created this blog to help other expecting mums who may be thinking of having a Breech Vaginal Birth. I hope this helps and if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment and I will get back to you.

## Humble Beginnings

Before the 11th June I had one son named Jackson who at the time was 7 years old. I was 26 when I gave birth to him. He was a normal straight forward vaginal delivery. During labour I requested an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/), it was great, I hardly felt anything!
I was 16 days late with Jackson which forced an [induced](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/inducing-labour/) labour, but he arrived safely weighing a lovely 6lb 6oz. During the pregnancy with Jackson, I regularly measured small on the growth charts resulting in regular growth scans.

![Antenatal Weight Chart](/antenatal-weight-chart.png "Example growth chart")

 As this was my second pregnancy and because I measured small with Jackson, I was automatically put forward for regular growth scans. During this second pregnancy, he was in the 5th percentile on this growth chart. By 32 weeks, he had managed to get back on track. During this scan, they mentioned that he was breech. This didn't concern me too much at the time, its quite common and the baby usually would turn before 36 weeks. I was booked in for another scan at 36 weeks to check on the progress and see if he has turned or not. This is where it all began, the doctor said that he was breech and it would be unlikely now that he turns by himself. This is due to the reduced space within the womb for him to move around.

 The doctor proceeded to offer me the following options:

1. [ECV](https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/maternity-services/pregnancy/pregnancy-complications/breech-baby-at-end-pregnancy-ecv) procedure – This procedure involves trying to manually turn the baby from outside of the womb. I've not heard or read good things about this process, but have a read of my experience further down.
2.	[Caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) – This would mean skipping the ECV and having the c-section at 39 weeks.
3.	*"We don’t recommend; however, you can have a vaginal breech birth and we will fully support your decision."*

Hearing a doctor say *"We don't recommend"* did not instil me with confidence. I'm not going to jump up and say *"Sign me up!"* to a procedure that isn't recommended. Questions started to race through my brain, but what I wanted to know is *"why?"*.
The doctors response was that a vaginal breech birth can cause damage to the hips along with some other complications. I had heard enough, sign me up for the ECV procedure please! 

I was curious to see if there was any natural methods of turning the baby such as those seen on websites like [spinning babies](https://www.spinningbabies.com/pregnancy-birth/baby-position/breech/flip-a-breech/). Quite a few mothers have suggested I try these techniques as they had a lot of joy with them. I decided to get the opinion of a medical professional whilst I can. The doctor replied confident **No**, *they are all nonsense!*

For me, the C-section would be a last resort. Roughly 4 years before this I moved from the West Midlands to Mansfield so I could live with my partner. The downside of this was that I didn't have any of my own family support within reasonable distance. Who would take Jackson to and from School? Who would look after my new son? Who would do chores around the house? I couldn't stand be doing nothing for 6 weeks, I have my mental health and well-being to think about. Yes, I know I could rely on my partner and his family to help out, but he only has 2 weeks of paternity, so what happens for the remaining 4 weeks? Besides, I like my independence and I like to clean! I'm most happy when I'm active and getting on with things. 
Let's try the ECV procedure and if its unsuccessful then I would have no choice but to go for the C-section.

> We don’t recommend; however, you can have a vaginal breech birth and we will fully support your decision.

After this consultation I researched online about vaginal breech deliveries. Most of the content that was available referenced a study that was published in April 2009. The result of this study was children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder were more than twice as likely to have been born breech.
I was happy with my decision to go down the path of ECV -> C-section thus ruling out the vaginal breech delivery...For now.

## The ECV

So, the doctor booked me in for the ECV the following week and prior to this I looked online and watched videos and read up on what happens. I will admit it made me feel anxious, but I had to try to say I did everything before committing to a C-Section.
My Midwife paid a routine home visit prior to this, and I mentioned that he was breech and I was booked in for an ECV. She told me that an ECV was only 50% effective. I was happy to go for it anyway so that was fine. She explained you have a scan prior and then they give you an injection to relax your uterus before manually trying to turn him by pushing on your tummy. She also said it could start labour and I would need to be at the hospital and to take my bags for me and baby (just in case).
She then said have you thought about what your plan is if it does not work? My response was I only have one which is a C-Section. She said what about a vaginal breech delivery?
I explained how the doctor said that he did not recommend it and mentioned about the hip scan and risk etc. She told me it does not matter. Your baby is breech now and will need a hip scan anyway. I did not know that if your baby is breech by 37 weeks you will automatically be booked for a hip scan anyway and there were no further risks at all to his hips by having a vaginal breech delivery. She told me she did not know why the doctor didn’t recommend it as there are no greater risks to a vaginal breech delivery than a regular vaginal birth. This made me think a little further and I effectively said its 1-1. 1 for, 1 against from professionals. (However, I did think I would side with a doctor over the midwife).
Anyway, I looked further into the Vaginal breech delivery and couldn’t find much on it and hardly no experiences! 
On the day of the ECV I was nervous and went into the hospital with butterflies and feeling sick! They gave me the scan and the injection in the tummy. (Sharp scratch) and the doctor began the ECV. 
I was anxious as I have an umbilical hernia which caused me daily pain throughout my pregnancy, and this is why I was more frightened by the ECV. However, he told me as soon as you say stop I will stop so I thought lets give it a go. 
He began the procedure, and my hernia did not hurt at all. The ECV was uncomfortable, very uncomfortable but I would not say painful. I read online it was really bad pain etc but let’s face it. You are a few weeks away from childbirth. It can’t hurt more than that! But honestly it did not hurt just very uncomfortable. 
The doctor managed to turn him 3 times but as soon as he let go the little bugger flipped back straight away. After a good 20 minutes I would say of trying. We gave up and the ECV was unsuccessful.
I do just want to say even though the ECV was unsuccessful and uncomfortable. I would highly recommend it. It’s not as bad as you read! Do not be put off. Go for it!

## The Decision

My midwife was with me during the ECV procedure, and she mentioned again about the vaginal breech birth. I asked the doctor what his thoughts were. (The Tiebreaker!).
He said yes go for it. There are no further risks, and you will need a hip scan on your son anyway. He said its easier for you as your body will do all the work. (I liked this idea!). I mentioned about the 26% chance of Autism. He said no not at all and that it was nonsense. He was a nice doctor, and I had this automatic feeling of trust with him and he said he recommended it and there were no further risks involved. My midwife said I could still have an epidural as this is what I wanted and then no C-Section and less recovery time. I discussed it with my partner whilst we waited for my Anti-D injection which you need after an ECV if you have a negative blood type. We discussed it and said yes ok let’s go for it.
When the nurse gave me my anti-d injection she said “I think its great you are having a vaginal breech delivery I really do”. 
This made me feel great! I felt like I had made the right decision and was proud. Me and Tom (my partner) both regretted not asking her Why!
We went home late as we had waited a long time for the Anti-D injection and decided to order a Chinese (Mummy’s favourite!). As soon as we ordered I had a light contraction. 4 minutes later I had another…. Then another. Oh Shit I thought! 
I called the maternity unit as my contractions were lasting 30 seconds each and 4 minutes apart but were not painful. She said as my baby is breech to come in. My Chinese was then delivered so I ate that first then went in. Nothing comes between me and Chinese food! Plus I hadn’t eaten all day as you cant eat before an ECV just in case you need a C-Section. If I was going into labour I needed my energy as it was 8pm. 
When I got to the hospital they put me on the monitor for 30 minutes or so and yes I was having light contractions. They examined me (which I cant stand and find so uncomfortable) and I was 2cm. She said I would be staying to see how I progressed because my baby was breech. I liked this as I was always worried the hospital send you home and then I wouldn’t get my epidural if it was too late. I was happy to stay in. However due to COVID Tom couldn’t be with me and sat out in the hall. 

## Labour

They took me to a delivery room to monitor me and Tom could be with me in the delivery room so I was happy. My contractions were very light but regular and she said have some paracetamol. As soon as I took these the contractions became irregular and I didn’t feel any. We got some sleep and they said they would examine me in 4 hours. After being examined I was still 2cm and not having regular contractions. I thought the ECV had set these off and it was false labour and they would send me home. The next morning they were talking of sending me home and had not examined me because I felt nothing and was fine. They agreed to send me home. I was gutted as I was so uncomfortable I wanted this baby out of me! 
I went to the toiler just before they were going to discharge me and I saw blood. A lot of Bright Red blood! I panicked! 
I called the nurse and she examined me. She said you are 4cm and you are not going anywhere. I was in labour! 
Contractions were none existent and even though the monitor was showing contractions they were so light, They were all calling me a trooper and how I was sailing through but I just didn’t feel much. Just slight period pain. 
Because I was having a vaginal breech delivery they asked if a student could be present. I said sure! Whilst I was talking to her she mentioned how rare a vaginal breech delivery was and how a midwife who was on the ward had been there for 5 years and never seen one before.
PANIC!!!!!
I had no idea how rare they were and why? I started to freak out and I wanted a C-Section. Why were they rare? Apparently there are a lot of boxes to tick to qualify which I did. 
2nd Child – Check
Ideal Birth Weight – Check
Correct Breech position (Not feet first but bum first) – Check
Some other factors that I was panicking too much to care about – Check
I was the perfect candidate, and I was like a celebrity on the ward. I had no idea and I felt they may be inexperienced, or something would happen! The student said the motto they learn at university is “Hands off the Breach”. They can not assist at all and I have to do all the work. I remember the ECV doctor saying your body does all the work but I didn’t know that they are unable to touch the baby during delivery or really assist. I found out later that apparently if you try to assist with helping the baby can startle and effectively put his hands up and get stuck. This is why they cant assist.
So I started to panic and I said I wanted an epidural as I didn’t want to feel the pain. The midwife almost pinned me up a corner and said you cant have an epidural. An epidural will result in a C-Section you need to do the work and if you cant feel anything you wont do it and it will end in a C-Section. Cue panic attack number 2. From this point I had to make a decision very quickly and I felt the whole world collapsing on me with pressure and fear. I started to cry with fear and as much a she tried to reassure me she was very stern and I felt I had no choice but to not have an epidural and continue. However I ended up thanking her after with a card and present.
So no progression happened and they broke my water at 8.30pm. But prior to this I was so scared of the pain even though I hardly had any I said if I cant have an epidural what can I have? They said pethidine. I immediately said yes and they gave me a shot just after they broke my waters and god am I glad! The minute my waters went the contraction pain went from zero to one hundred! It was intense just as I remembered with Jackson before my epidural. The pethidine kicked in and it “knocked the edge off” but was still painful. At one point I said no I cant continue just give me the epidural or a C-Section. The midwife said we will examine you and if you can have an epidural we will give you one. She examined me at 10.00pm and said you are 10cm dilated its time to push and its too late. I remember the fear and begging Tom to help but it was too late. I was going to have a breech delivery.
Even though it felt like from my waters breaking at 8.30pm to me wanting to push was like 5 minutes it turned out to be an hour and half and I had the urge to push at 10.00pm when they had just told me I was 10cm. I wanted it over as quickly as possible to reduce the number of contractions. 
At this point there were 8 people in the room from students to midwives to specialist doctors “just in case”. This reassured me. They really do prepare, and you have everyone there who needs to be. The more the merrier to me even if I was an absolute mess! I had the gas and air and even though this made me very sick with Jacksons birth it was a god send with this labour and I wasn’t sick. 
As I pushed it was actually easier than my mind had made out it was going to be. They took the end of the bed away as the baby has to almost dangle out of you with no assistance from the medical teams. This helped with the delivery I feel even though they didn’t touch. Don’t touch the breech! 
It was a weird sensation but I feel the ECV doctor was right. My body was doing the work and all I had to do was push. However I needed more hands and that’s where Tom came in. My guardian angel! 
I needed my hands to push/pull on my legs to push with all my might and I also needed that god send of gas and air. I was also absolutely roasting so Tom held a cold wet maternity pad on my forehead whilst holding the gas and air in my mouth and somehow with a random 3rd hand he had mastered up still managed to hold my hand. I didn’t look around me much I just focused on Toms face and ignored everyone who else who spoke to me. 
Once I had pushed his bum out. The little monkey decided to poo all down me. But all my dignity had been lost anyway so who gave a shit. (Apart from my son).
At one point I do remember a dryness pain which hurt and I screamed. I NEED LUBE! Tom then said they got a cream that they smeared around “my bits” which lubricated and also numbed the area. This immediately helped and I continued to push. I think this dryness pain was the most painful bit so if you are going ahead with a breech delivery just make sure they use this or have it at least on standby. This made the process a lot easier. 
I pushed out his bum and Tom said his legs just followed and almost “fell out”. Gravity and my body then helped and then it was time for the head. Still with all 8 people plus tom just standing back and what felt like doing jack shit it was time for the big finale. I remember not wanting a single contraction more and knew it was down to me to get the head out in as little contractions as possible. I pushed with all my might and I suggest you savour your energy and give it everything you have! I did it in 1 to save another single painful contraction. Then like that he was here! 
Harrison was born 11/06/2021 at 10.34pm weighing 6lb 3oz. He was just perfect! 
He did have a bruise on his thigh from the delivery and he did also have to go to NICU as he had grunting which meant he couldn’t breathe very well. Harrison was 3 weeks early and ended up with a chest infection but this was not down to the fact he was breech and was just an unfortunate factor. He was in the NICU for 3 days and on antibiotics for 5 days. He also had jaundice which meant we were in the hospital for 7 days before we were all united again after COVID restrictions kept us all apart. Being home was the most amazing feeling and its made me love Tom even more if its at all possible. Even though the medical team were incredible I couldn’t of done it without Tom he was my rock and we are as happy as ever. 
Also the midwife (Anne) who I almost at one point felt pressured by to not have an epidural I actually thank. I’m so proud that I did it and I would have been gutted if I had given up. Its down to her! Thank you Anne! I understand now why she was so against the epidural as it wouldn’t of happened the way it did. Immediately after the birth I was up and about and was able to move freely between the maternity ward and ICU to still breast feed Harrison every 3 hours which aided in his recovery and helped me bond. If I have had a C-Section I’m sure this would have been a lot more difficult. I was able to visit, stay with him, dress him change him, feed him as much as I liked between the ward and NICU and this kept me sane! I just wanted to be with him and I didn’t have Tom or Jackson and felt very very lonely and locked up so I’m so glad I had the option and capability to be with Harrison when ever I needed to be. 

## Home Time

1 week later we were released! Harrison is doing amazing and Jackson loves his little brother. Our beautiful family is complete and I don’t regret a thing! Please please if you take anything from this blog is to consider a vaginal Breech and ask as many questions to your health providers as possible to ensure you are happy and confident with your decision. I would recommend it to anyone and I’m so glad I didn’t chicken out and went for it. I’m so proud of myself and Harrison. 
Every appointment we have as soon as they see I had a vaginal breech delivery they say, OH WOW! Well done you! You really do become a medical celebrity its actually quite nice! 
A vaginal breech is a rare occasion that happens as its so easy to have a C section nowadays but from my personal experience. Go for it! Being able to come home and move about freely with less recovery etc and provide again for my family (and clean to help my anxiety) is amazing. I wouldn’t of changed a thing. My main aim throughout this whole process was to have no regrets and I have none.

Any questions please feel free to ask as I would love to help anyone in the same situation. 


## With Thanks

I want to say a massive thank you to Kingsmill Hospital in Mansfield who were amazing with special thanks to Anne and Emily the midwifes and the 2 student nurses Jodie and Ellie. Also the NICU unit were amazing!!! 
I couldn’t of done it without them and because of them we are now home and a very happy family. I also want to thank Tom who I couldn’t of done it without. He has also made this blog for me to share with you all so I hope you found it helpful.
Here is a picture of Jackson and Harrison together at last.
I hope you found this helpful!
