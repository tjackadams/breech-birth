Hello. My name is Faye and I wanted to write my experience on a vaginal breech delivery I had with my second son (and my last child!) on 11th June 2021. 
When I was offered a vaginal breech delivery, I couldn’t find any blog on peoples personal experiences and only articles which I didn’t find helpful. I wanted to ask questions of someone who had actually experienced it. Hence I have created this blog to help other expecting mums who may be thinking of having a Breech Vaginal Birth. I hope this helps and if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me on twitter (link at the bottom of the page).

## Humble Beginnings

Before the 11th June I had one son named Jackson who at the time was 7 years old. I was 26 when I gave birth to him. He was a normal straight forward vaginal delivery. During labour I requested an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/), it was great, I hardly felt anything!
I was 16 days late with Jackson which forced an [induced](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/inducing-labour/) labour, but he arrived safely weighing a lovely 6lb 6oz. During the pregnancy with Jackson, I regularly measured small on the growth charts resulting in regular growth scans. Below is an example of a growth chart with the first 2 X's where you should be. The 3rd X shows where Jackson was and hence the growth scans.

 As this was my second pregnancy and because I measured small with Jackson, I was automatically put forward for regular growth scans. During this second pregnancy, he was in the 5th percentile on this growth chart. By 32 weeks, he had managed to get back on track. During this scan, they mentioned that he was breech. This didn't concern me too much at the time, its quite common and the baby usually would turn before 36 weeks. I was booked in for another scan at 36 weeks to check on the progress and see if he has turned or not. This is where it all began, the doctor said that he was breech and it would be unlikely now that he turns by himself. This is due to the reduced space within the womb for him to move around.

 The doctor proceeded to offer me the following options:

1. [ECV](https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/maternity-services/pregnancy/pregnancy-complications/breech-baby-at-end-pregnancy-ecv) procedure – This procedure involves trying to manually turn the baby from outside of the womb. I've not heard or read good things about this process, but have a read of my experience further down.
2.	[Caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) – This would mean skipping the ECV and having the c-section at 39 weeks.
3.	*"We don’t recommend; however, you can have a vaginal breech birth and we will fully support your decision."*

Hearing a doctor say *"We don't recommend"* did not instil me with confidence. I'm not going to jump up and say *"Sign me up!"* to a procedure that isn't recommended. Questions started to race through my brain, but what I wanted to know is *"why?"*.
The doctors response was that a vaginal breech birth can cause damage to the hips along with some other complications. I had heard enough, sign me up for the ECV procedure please! 

I was curious to see if there was any natural methods of turning the baby such as those seen on websites like [spinning babies](https://www.spinningbabies.com/pregnancy-birth/baby-position/breech/flip-a-breech/). Quite a few mothers have suggested I try these techniques as they had a lot of joy with them. I decided to get the opinion of a medical professional whilst I can. The doctor replied confident **No**, *they are all nonsense!*

For me, the C-section would be a last resort. Roughly 4 years before this I moved from the West Midlands to Mansfield so I could live with my partner. The downside of this was that I didn't have any of my own family support within reasonable distance. Who would take Jackson to and from School? Who would look after my new son? Who would do chores around the house? I couldn't stand to be doing nothing for 6 weeks and taking it easy, this is not the kind of person I am. I have my mental health and well-being to think about. Yes, I know I could rely on my partner and his family to help out, but he only has 2 weeks of paternity, so what happens for the remaining 4 weeks? Besides, I like my independence and I like to clean! I'm most happy when I'm active and getting on with things. 
Let's try the ECV procedure and if its unsuccessful then I would have no choice but to go for the C-section.

> We don’t recommend; however, you can have a vaginal breech birth and we will fully support your decision.

After this consultation I researched online about vaginal breech deliveries. Most of the content that was available referenced a study that was published in April 2009. The result of this study was children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder were more than twice as likely to have been born breech.
I was happy with my decision to go down the path of ECV -> C-section thus ruling out the vaginal breech delivery...For now.

## The ECV

The doctor made an appointment for the following week. During this time I decided to do some research so I know what to expect during the ECV procedure. I will admit that watching the videos online did make me feel very anxious, but I felt I had to give it a try. This way I can say I tried everything before conceding to a C-section.
A few days before the ECV procedure, my midwife paid a routine home visit to my house. We discussed the ECV procedure and she informed me that its only about 50% effective, I was happy to continue. 

My midwife explained that you have a scan before to ensure baby is still breech and an injection to relax the uterus. The procedure can start labour as well, so it would need to be performed on the labour ward and we should take our bags. She went on to ask *"have you thought about what your plan is if the ECV does not work?"*. I replied with *"C-section"*. She said "what about vaginal breech delivery?".

> Why wouldnt he recommend it?

I explained how the doctor didn't recommend a vaginal breech delivery and mentioned about the hip scan and risks involved. She told me it does not matter, your baby is breech now and will need a hip scan regardless. I was unaware that if your baby is breech by 37 weeks then you'll be booked in for  a hip scan. There is also no further risks to the hips by having a vaginal breech delivery. My midwife was rather confused on why the doctor wouldn't recommend a vaginal breech birth. There is no greater risks involved with a vaginal breech delivery compared to a normal vaginal delivery or C-section. This gave me a lot to think about, however my initial reaction was to side with the doctor over the midwife.

Here's the current scores.

After the midwife had left I researched vaginal breech delivery as much as I could, but failed to find much on the subject and hardly any first hand accounts. On the day of the ECV procedure I was nervous and feeling sick. Before I became pregnant, I suffered with an umbilical hernia. I had an operation to fix it by attaching a mesh on the inside of my stomach by staples. The mesh had come away and caused me daily pain throughout my pregnancy. I was frightened that the ECV procedure might make this pain even worse. 

The midwife and doctor gave me the scan and injection into the stomach, the doctor began the procedure. The thing I had been so worried about, my hernia hurting actually didn't hurt at all. The ECV was uncomfortable, very uncomfortable, but let's face it, you are a few weeks away from childbirth. It can't and doesn't hurt more than that! The doctor had managed to turn him 3 times, but as soon as the doctor let go the little bugger flipped back to his original position. Looks like he was settled where he was.
After about 20 minutes we gave up and the ECV was unsuccessful. 

I would like to emphasise that even though the ECV was unsuccessful and uncomfortable, I would highly recommend it. Its not as bad as people make out on the internet. Don't be put off, go for it!

## The Decision

During the ECV procedure, my midwife brought up the subject of a vaginal breech birth again. I asked the doctor what his thoughts were, the tiebreaker? He said "*Yes, go for it*". There would be no further risks and your son will need a hip scan anyway because he is breech. He also mentioned that a vaginal breech birth is easier as gravity and my body will do all the work for me. I liked this idea!

I mentioned to the doctor about the increased chance of Autism and he said there wasn't any, it was all nonsense. He was a nice doctor and I had this automatic feeling of trust with him. He went on to recommend vaginal breech birth and reiterated there were no further risks involved.

My midwife went on to explain that I was still eligible for an epidural which is what I wanted. I needed another anti-d injection after the ECV procedure, so this presented a good opportunity to talk it over with my partner. In the end we decided to go for the vaginal breech delivery, with a C-section as a last resort. 

Some time later the anti-D injection finally arrived and the nurse said " I think it's great you are having a vaginal breech delivery, I really do".

> I think it's great you are having a vaginal breech delivery, I really do. 

This was what I needed to hear, it made me feel great and I felt like I had made the right decision and was proud. My only regret is not asking her why!

After the anti-D injection we went home, it was getting late in the evening so we ordered A Ttakeaway, mummy's favourite, Chinese. You are not allowed to eat before the ECV procedure in-case you end up having an emergency C-section, so by this time I was starving. A few minutes after ordering the Chinese, I had a light contraction. A few minutes later I had another...then another. "Oh shit", I had better start timing these.
My contractions were lasting 30 seconds each and roughly 4 minutes apart, but not painful. I called the Maternity unit and because he was breech, they asked if we could come in. "Let me finish my Chinese and I'll be right there". I wasnt giving up my chinese food so easily.
I arrived at the hospital and placed on a monitor for 30 minutes and it was confirmed, I was having light contractions. They examined me (which I can't stand and find so uncomfortable) and I was 2cm dilated. I would be staying in the hospital overnight to monitor my progress. I was happy about this as I have been worried about not getting to the hospital in time and missing my epidural. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, Tom couldn't be with me and had to sit out in the hallway.

## Early Labour

After a few hours I was moved to the labour ward and Tom could join me again so I was happy. My contractions were very light but regular. I was offered some paracetamol and ibuprofen as pain relief, but I really didn't need it. Not long after I had taken the pain relief, the contraction became irregular and I felt them even less than before. They said they would examine me in another 4 hours which means we could try and get some sleep. The second examination showed I was still 2cm dilated and I wasn't having regular contractions anymore. They said the ECV could have set this off and it was false labour. If I didn't show any progress by the following morning then I would be sent home. I was gutted and so uncomfortable. I wanted this baby out of me! 

The next morning, my contractions were still irregular and the plan was to send me home. Before they discharged me, I went to the toilet and...I saw blood. A lot of bright red blood! Could this be [The Show?](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/) I panicked. I called for the midwife and asked to be examined. To my surprise she said "*You're 4cm dilated! You're not going anywhere.*"

**I was in labour.**

I was barely feeling any of my contractions. Even though the monitor was showing contractions, they were so light. The midwives were calling me a trooper because I just sailed through it. I didn't feel much, just a slight period pain.
As I was having a vaginal breech delivery, I was asked if a student midwife could be present. I said sure! I got talking to the student midwife and she mentioned just how rare vaginal breech births are nowadays. There was a midwife on the ward who had worked there for 5 years and never seen one before.

**_Panic!_**

I had no idea how rare they were, but why? I started to freak out and I immediately wanted the C-section. Why were they so rare? Well there is a lot of criteria needed to qualify to be suitable and safe for a vaginal breech delivery. These were.

* [x] Not first pregnancy.
* [x] Ideal Birth Weight.
* [x] Correct breech position (bum first).
* [x] Other factors, but I was panicking too much to care.

I was the perfect candidate for a vaginal breech birth and it felt like I was a celebrity on the ward. I had no idea and it made me feel like the ward would be ill-equipped to handle this. The student midwife told me the motto they learn at university when dealing with vaginal breech births, Hands off the Breech. 

> Hands off the breech.

They try not to assist at all, leaving my body and gravity to do the work. I remember the ECV doctor saying something similar, but I wasn't aware this meant they are unable to touch the baby during delivery. I found out later the reason for this is if you try and help the baby, they can get startled, put their hands up and get stuck.

The panic and worry started to set in so I requested the epidural, the pain frightened me. The midwife, with her dominant and intimidating presence, took me to one side and told it how it was. You need to do all the work and you can't do that with an epidural. You need to feel the push. If you have an epidural, you will need a C-section. I'm telling you that if you have an epidural I guarentee you will have a C-section!
The panic and fear I felt at this point was unimaginable, but I had to make a decision very quickly. The pressure felt like the whole world was waiting for my decision. I felt at this point, I had no other choice but to deny the epidural and continue on. The midwife was very stern and at the time, I had some very colourful adjectives to describe her. However, once everything was said and done, I ended up thanking her with a card and a present. In that moment, she is what I needed.

## Labour

As an epidural was no longer a viable option, I asked what alternatives there were. With Jacksons birth, I didn't get on very well with gas & air, but I seemed fine with it this time around, even though it didn't seem to do much. [Pethidine](https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/maternity-services/pain-management-options/pethidine-injection) was the painkiller offered to me and I could have this after my next examination at 8pm. If i hadnt progressed they were going to break my waters which they didnt really want to do if they could help it but things weren't moving.

8pm rolled around and the midwife examined me. Still no progress. The midwife proceeded to break my waters and my contraction pain went from zero to one hundred! The midwife had the Pethidine ready and gave me a shot with an anti-sickness agent. The pain was intense, this is how I remembered labour with Jackson before I had the epidural. The Pethidine kicked in and "knocked the edge off" but I was still in pain.

As time passed, the pain became more intense and at one point I felt like I couldn't continue and asked the midwife for an epidural or C-section (the thing I had tried to avoid I suddenly wanted so that the contraction pain was taken away!). The midwife said we'll examine you again and if you can have an epidural then we'll give you one. The midwife examined me at 10pm and said you are 10cm dilated and its time to push, its too late for an epidural or C-section. I remember the fear running through me and turning to Tom for help, begging for help. It was no good, it was too late, I was going to have a vaginal breech delivery.

From the moment my waters broke to my 10pm examination, it felt like only a few minutes had passed. Things started to move fast after the 10pm examination when I was told I was 10cm dilated. The room was quickly transformed into a delivery room, with the bottom of the bed removed. Midwives, students and specialist doctors quickly arrived as precaution. This reassured me as you have everyone there who needs to be there, the more the merrier.

I wanted this to be over as quickly as possible to reduce the number of contractions I had to endure. As I began to push, it felt easier than my mind had made out it was going to be. It was a weird sensation but I feel the ECV doctor was right. My body and gravity was doing all the work for me, all I had to do was push at the end of a contraction. Yet, I needed more hands to make this easier and that's where Tom came in, my guardian angel!

I used my hands to push with all my might against my legs during a contraction. Tom supplied the gas & air as well as hold a maternity pad soaked in cold water on my forehead, I was roasting! I didn't look around the room much, I just focused on Tom's face and ignored everyone else who spoke to me.

Once I had pushed the bum out, my son decided to have a poo all down my leg. All dignity had been lost by this point anyway so who gives a shit. 💩

During the latter stages of giving birth, I remember a very distinct dryness pain caused me to scream out. I NEED LUBE! This was shouted several times before the doctors applied a cream to "my bits". This cream lubricated and also numbed the pain. I would recommend asking for this cream to be on standby if you're going down the vaginal breech delivery route.

His bum was out and soon after his legs just flopped out. Gravity and my body were working in tandem towards a common goal. After a few more pushes, his arms and shoulders were out, only the head left to go. It was time for the big finale. I remember not wanting a single contraction more, but it was up to me to make that happen.

I pushed with everything I had left and I suggest you savour some energy for this moment. I managed to push him out in 1, saving anymore painful contractions. Then like that, he was here.

Harrison was born 11/06/2021 at 10:34pm weighing 6lb 3oz. He was just perfect.

## Post Labour

Harrison was born with quite a large bruise on his thigh caused by the delivery. He also had trouble keeping his temperature up and grunting when breathing. After some further diagnosis, he was suspected to have a chest infection, so he was sent down to NICU for further care. A chest x-ray confirmed he had a chest infection, but they had already started him on anti-biotics. He also had mild jaundice, which meant in total he spent 3 days in NICU and 4 days on the maternity ward. I would like to stress that none of the above were caused by a vaginal breech delivery, it was just unfortunate.

While Harrison was in the NICU it was brilliant as we could visit him 24/7. I was going down during the nights to breast feed him and Tom would pop up and spend time with us. It was really difficult when Harrison was moved back to the maternity ward. Tom could only visit once a day for 2 hours due COVID-19 restrictions and for 1 whole day Harrison was under a lamp for his jaundice so I felt useless and alone. 

## Home Time

 After 7 long days in hospital, we were finally discharged! Being home was the most amazing feeling and its made me love Tom even more, if its at all possible. Event though the medical team were incredible, I couldn't have done it without Tom. He was my rock and we are as happy as ever.

Harrison is doing amazing and Jackson loves his little brother. Our beautiful family is complete and I don’t regret a thing! Please please if you take anything from this blog is to consider a vaginal breech delivery and ask as many questions to your health providers as possible. I would recommend it to anyone and I’m so glad I didn’t chicken out. I’m so proud of myself and Harrison. 
Every appointment we have had since, as soon as they see I had a vaginal breech delivery they say, OH WOW! Well done you! You really do become a medical celebrity, its actually quite nice! 
A vaginal breech delivery is a rare occasion that happens as its so easy to have a C-section nowadays but from my personal experience. Go for it! Being able to come home and move about freely with less recovery time and provide again for my family (and clean to help my anxiety) is amazing. I wouldn’t of changed a thing. My main aim throughout this whole process was to have no regrets and I have none.

Any questions please feel free to ask as I would love to help anyone in the same situation. 


## With Thanks

I want to say a massive thank you to Kingsmill Hospital in Mansfield who were amazing with special thanks to Anne and Emily the midwifes and the 2 student nurses Jodie and Ellie. Also the NICU unit were amazing!!! 
I couldn’t of done it without them and because of them we are now home and a very happy family. I also want to thank Tom who I couldn’t of done it without. He has also made this blog for me to share with you all so I hope you found it helpful.
Here is a picture of Jackson and Harrison together at last.
I hope you found this helpful! 
Take Care and good luck and remember. You can do this! 
Lots of Love
